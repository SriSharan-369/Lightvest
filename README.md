# Lightvest

About this project:

The increasing number of people using bicycles for the green revolution has led to a rise in the number of bicycle accidents, particularly during the night due to insufficient lighting and visibility. The LightVest is a bike vest that has been designed to address this issue. This vest features programmable RGB LEDs that can be controlled by a wireless remote with customizable buttons, as well as an accelerometer that enables hands-free control of turn signals. Additionally, the vest has a smart mode that sends data and tracks the cyclist's journey by phone. The LightVest offers a solution to increase visibility and improve communication with other motorists and pedestrians on the road, potentially reducing the number of bicycle accidents and increasing cyclist safety.

Scope:

The LightVest offers a solution to increase cyclist visibility and safety on the road, particularly during the night. With its innovative features, such as programmable LEDs and hands-free turn signals, the vest provides a feasible and efficient solution to the problem of life-threatening accidents caused by a lack of visibility.
